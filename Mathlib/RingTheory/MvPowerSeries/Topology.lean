/-! # Topology on power series

Let `α` be with Semiring α` and `TopologicalSpace α`
In this file we the topology on `MvPowerSeries σ α`
that corresponds to the simple convergence on its coefficients.
It is the coarsest topology for which all coefficients maps are continuous.

When `α` has `UniformSpace α`, we define the corresponding uniform structure.

When the type of coefficients has the discrete topology,
it corresponds to the topology defined by [bourbaki1981], chapter 4, §4, n°2

It is *not* the adic topology in general.

- `tendsto_pow_zero_of_constantCoeff_nilpotent`, `tendsto_pow_zero_of_constantCoeff_zero`:
if the constant coefficient of `f` is nilpotent, or vanishes,
then the powers of `f` converge to zero.

- `tendsto_pow_of_constantCoeff_nilpotent_iff` : the powers of `f` converge to zero iff
the constant coefficient of `f` is nilpotent

- `hasSum_of_monomials_self` : viewed as an infinite sum, a power series coverges to itself

TODO: add the similar result for the series of homogeneous components

## Instances

- If `α` is a topological (semi)ring, then so is `MvPowerSeries σ α`

- If the topology of `α` is T2, then so is that of `MvPowerSeries σ α``

- If `α` is a `uniformAddGroup`, then so is `MvPowerSeries σ α``

- If `α` is complete, then so is `MvPowerSeries σ α`
