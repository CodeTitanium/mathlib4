/--
`grw` is a generalization of the `rw` tactic that takes other relations than equality.  For example,
```lean
example (h₁ : a + e ≤ b + e)
    (h₂ : b < c)
    (h₃ : c ≤ d) :
    a + e ≤ d + e := by
  grw [h₂, h₃] at h₁
  exact h₁
```

If applied to a hypothesis or target of type `p` with rule of type `x ~ y` (where `~` is some
relation) then the resulting type will be `p[x/y]`.

If applied to the target then the tactic will attempt to close the goal with `rfl` after doing the
rewriting.
